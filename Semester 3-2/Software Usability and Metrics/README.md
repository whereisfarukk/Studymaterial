  //return square
   return a*a;

#how many line are in there-(4,3,6),all are correct.Ans are depends on the question.

What is measurement model?
=>making the unmeasureable measureable.

#Types of model
1.Text
2.Diagramatic
3.Algorithm.


1.Text:

Defects: Incompletenese of the product or wrong use case eyc.
Agile model is a text model.

2.Diagramatic:
(graph) feature->size->effort->cost,effort->schedule->defects,size -> defects

3.Algorithm.

effort = schedule * resource
       = A*(Sizeof Program^B)+C

response time : diagram

ResponseTime = (start of decorate - end of decorate)

how to measure anything? nije pora.

Another model:
Meta model for metrics:
define concept(response time)-> define(how to measure time)(average response time in one hour(absatruct)) -> operational definition(clearing abstruct definition)(avaerage response time in one hour(calculation))->measurement of real world.






# Measurement scale
1.Nominal(mode)
2.Ordinal(median)
3.Interval(mode,medium,mean)
4.Ratio
5.Absolute

1.Nominal:Unordered set of categories.


2.Ordinal:Ordered set of categories.Can't compare with each other categorie.Like we cant say 2 major bug > 4 minor bug.


3.Interval:If there is consistent difference, we measure it via interval.


4.Ratio:

5.Absolute: Number of occurance.There is no negative value.




#Variability

### Range:between low and high point in data.

### Daviation:Mean -> distance.

### Variance: sumof(Deviations^2/N)


### Standard Deviation:rootof(Variance)

### Index of Variation: Standard Deviation/mean.
